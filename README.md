## Working Steps

1. Will create a multi-authentication system for the admin, station officer and users, where users cannot access admin roles and permission.
2. Login and registration of station officer and normal police personnel
3. An admin will approve the registration request of the user for the station officer role. 
4. A station officer will have a list of all the police personnel serving in that particular police station, station officer. He can add, update and delete the tasks of police personnel and also change their status. 
5. The police personnel (user) can see the task assigned to them and can change the status of their task (pending, ongoing, completed). 
6. The admin will have the access to make a user or station officer inactive. 
7. A station officer or admin can add police personnel with different roles and permissions (Head constable, Station House Officer (SHO) will have different role and permission). 
8. Station officer can search police personnel to whom he wants to add the next tasks.
